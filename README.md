# Introduction
This repo bootstraps the tensorflow inception transfer learning to quickly selfmade image classifications.

All you need are pictures you want to classify and put them in the folder `train_images`. You need to put the pictures of each class into its own folder. See below.


## Folder structure 
Fill the folder train\_images with images you want to classify. Each class gets its own folder with the images who belong to that class


### Example

We have 2 classes, puppies and kitties with 100 pictures each:


```
./kitty
           /kitty001.jpg
           /kitty002.jpg
           /kitty003.jpg
       ...
           /kitty098.jpg
           /kitty099.jpg
           /kitty100.jpg

./puppy
           /puppy001.jpg
           /puppy002.jpg
           /puppy003.jpg
       ...
           /puppy098.jpg
           /puppy099.jpg
           /puppy100.jpg

```
